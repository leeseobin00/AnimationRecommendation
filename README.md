# Animation Recommendation

Predicting what animation tend to get higher vote counts.

Predicting animation revenue and/or animation success based on a certain metric.

Recommending animation to users. 

We use the dataset in Kaggle

# Modeling
## Collaborative Recommender
### Using Apriori

- Use rating to find clusters of similar users and predict using K average ratings.

- When a user enters the title of a video he or she is watching, the cosine similarity is 
  calculated using a pivot table and the video with the highest similarity is recommended.

## Collaborative Recommender - Item based
### Using KNN(Cosine similarity)

- Use rating to find clusters of similar users and predict using K average ratings.

- When a user enters the title of a video he or she is watching, the cosine similarity is 
  calculated using a pivot table and the video with the highest similarity is recommended.

## Content Based Recommender
### Using TF-IDF weighting and Sigmoid_kernel

- TF-IDF, or term frequency-inverse document frequency, is a figure that expresses the 
  statistical importance of any given word to the document collection as a whole. TF-IDF is 
  calculated by multiplying term frequency and inverse document frequency.

- Sigmoid function returns two values, 0 and 1, therefore it is more suitable for binary 
  classification problems.
